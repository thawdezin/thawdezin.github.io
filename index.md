### Hi, I'm **Thaw De Zin** (​သော်ဒီဇင်) a.k.a Thaw Di Zin

I am **Mobile Developer** passionate about creating innovative mobile applications using `Flutter`, `Jetpack Compose` and `Python`. I graduated from [University of Technology (Yatanarpon Cyber City)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology,_Yadanabon_Cyber_City) in February 2020, as part of the 4th batch of the `Bachelor of Engineering` in `Information Science and Technology` program. The graduation was prior to the [2021 Myanmar coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).

### About Me

During my university studies, I gained experience in a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, and MATLAB. My projects covered a range of fields, including **image processing, artificial intelligence, web development, the Internet of Things, Android development, big data, high-performance computing, web scraping and web crawling.**

After graduation, I chose a career in [mobile development](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thawdezin/), utilizing the skills and knowledge I gained in university. My programming expertise spans multiple languages, including Assembly (NASM) with a focus on compiler design and structure. However, I have a strong affinity for `Python` and `Dart`, and I am proficient in `Flutter` for mobile development. In my free time, I enjoy exploring cryptocurrencies, as well as learning `Flutter` and continuing to hone my `Python` skills.
